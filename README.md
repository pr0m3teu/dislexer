# Dislexer
## Simple lexer written in C.
I started this small project in order to test my understandment of memory managment and string manipulations in C. 

## Memory 
I've tried to make it 'memory safe' by making it now leak any memory. (I don't as of right now know if 'memory safe is the right term here')
Even though I am deallocating everything there are, I believe, too many heap allocations and I'm trying to lower their number.
